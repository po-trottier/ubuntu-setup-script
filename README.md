# Ubuntu Setup Script

This simple bash script was written in order to facilitate the setup process for my ubuntu-based distribution installs.

It allows the installation of a few useful softwares I use frequently.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run this command as a regular user in the terminal.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/po-trottier/ubuntu-setup-script/main/setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh && rm ./setup.sh
```
